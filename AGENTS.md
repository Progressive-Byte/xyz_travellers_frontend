# Workflow Orchestration

Disciplined task execution with planning, verification, and self-improvement loops.

Use when:
- Starting non-trivial tasks (3+ steps)
- Fixing bugs
- Building features
- Refactoring code
- When rigorous execution with quality gates is needed 

Includes:
- Subagent delegation
- Lessons tracking
- Staff-engineer-level verification

--------------------------------------------------
Quick Reference
--------------------------------------------------

Plan Mode
  Apply for any task with 3+ steps or architectural decisions

Subagents
  Use for research, exploration, and parallel analysis

Lessons
  Update after ANY user correction

Verification
  Required before marking any task complete

Elegance Check
  Apply to non-trivial changes only

--------------------------------------------------
1. Plan Mode Default
--------------------------------------------------

- Enter plan mode for ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions)
- If something goes sideways, STOP and re-plan immediately
- Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity

--------------------------------------------------
2. Subagent Strategy
--------------------------------------------------

Keep the main context window clean:

- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents
- For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subagents
- One task per subagent for focused execution

--------------------------------------------------
3. Self-Improvement Loop
--------------------------------------------------

After ANY correction from the user:

- Update tasks/lessons.md with the pattern
- Write rules that prevent the same mistake
- Review lessons at session start

See references/lessons-format.md for the template.

--------------------------------------------------
4. Verification Before Done
--------------------------------------------------

- Never mark a task complete without proving it works
- Diff behavior between main and your changes when relevant
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"
- Run tests, check logs, demonstrate corrections

--------------------------------------------------
5. Demand Elegance (Balanced)
--------------------------------------------------

For non-trivial changes:
- Pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"
- If a fix feels hacky: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution"

Skip this for simple, obvious fixes — don't over-engineer

--------------------------------------------------
6. Autonomous Bug Fixing
--------------------------------------------------

When given a bug report:

- Just fix it. Don't ask for hand-holding
- Point at logs, errors, failing tests — then resolve them
- Zero context switching required from the user

--------------------------------------------------
Task Management Protocol
--------------------------------------------------

Plan First:
- Write plan to tasks/todo.md with checkable items

Verify Plan:
- Check in before starting implementation

Track Progress:
- Mark items complete as you go

Explain Changes:
- High-level summary at each step

Document Results:
- Add review to tasks/todo.md

Capture Lessons:
- Update tasks/lessons.md after corrections

See references/task-templates.md for file templates.

Core Principles
--------------------------------------------------

- Simplicity First: Make every change as simple as possible
- No Laziness: Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards
- Minimal Impact: Only touch what's necessary. Avoid introducing bugs
